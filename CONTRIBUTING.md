###How to Contribute

Before contributing for the first time, you must <a href="https://gist.github.com/OXID-Admin/6df6ed126d074a54507d">sign the Contributor License Agreement</a>.
You can find more information about it on the FAQ page OXID Contribution and Contributor Agreement FAQ:
http://wiki.oxidforge.org/OXID_Contribution_and_Contributor_Agreement_FAQ

First off, you have to fork current repository.

<b>Best practice</b>:
* Please leave the the branch names as they are.
* If you want to fix a bug or develop a new feature, define an own branch in your repository. Name it e.g. "feature/foo" or "bug/bugname" for better traceability.
* Change whatever you want and send a pull request back to the original branch.

When sending your pull request, please provide a clear, meaningful and detailed information about what your code is about and what it will do, best including a screen shot if possible.
