======

![OXID eFire extension paypal](paypal_banner.jpg)

### Features

* PayPal is available as a regular payment method in the appropriate checkout step.
* PayPal express is already included at the checkout (registration step), at the so called “mini cart” and at the product detail pages.
* The module is highly customizable through many options at the admin panel, for example the step to transfer the money (at the order date or on delivery).
* Options are adjustable in different ways for each multishop (OXID eShop Enterprise Edition only).
* The payment page at PayPal can be customized by your own logo and the name of your online store.
* If you wish, you can transfer the content of the cart (purchased product items) to PayPal. Your customer has to decide whether this data shall be transferred or not.
* Partial payment is possible.
* The admin panel provides an overview of the PayPal payments per order.

### Running tests locally

To run this module tests locally, ensure the `test_config.yml` values are correct:
- Set `module_ids` to `oepaypal`
- Set `activate_all_modules` to `true`
- Set `run_tests_for_modules` to `true`
- Set `run_tests_for_shop` to `false`
- Set `additional_test_paths` to `''`
- Set `retry_times_after_test_fail` to `0`

For running acceptance and codeception tests you need to provide sandbox credentials data:
- Set `sOEPayPalSandboxUsername`
- Set `sOEPayPalSandboxPassword`
- Set `sOEPayPalSandboxSignature`
- Set `blOEPayPalSandboxMode` to `true`
- Set `blPayPalLoggerEnabled` to `true`
- Set `OEPayPalClientId`

These credentials can be set in shop_dir/var/configuration/environment/1.yaml. More information about it can be found [here](https://oxidforge.org/en/deployment-concepts-starting-from-oxid-eshop-6-2-0.html).

```yaml
modules:
  oepaypal:
    moduleSettings:
      oePayPalClientId:
        value: client_id
      sOEPayPalSandboxUsername:
        value: sandbox_user
      sOEPayPalSandboxPassword:
        value: sandbox_password
      sOEPayPalSandboxSignature:
        value: sandbox_signature
      blOEPayPalSandboxMode:
        value: true
      blPayPalLoggerEnabled:
        value: true
```

Also PayPal login credentials will be needed, they can be set in module_dir/.env file:

- Set `sBuyerLogin`
- Set `sBuyerPassword`
- Set `sBuyerFirstName`
- Set `sBuyerLastName`

```
sBuyerLogin=pp_buyer_email
sBuyerPassword=pp_buyer_pass
sBuyerFirstName=pp_buyer_first_name
sBuyerLastName=pp_buyer_last_name
```

#### When all credentials are set up you can run the following commands:
```shell
# Installs the module, activates it and applies the configurations from shop_dir/var/configuration/environment/1.yaml file
bin/oe-console oe:module:install vendor/oxid-esales/paypal-module
bin/oe-console oe:module:activate oepaypal
bin/oe-console oe:module:apply-configuration
# Runs codeception tests
vendor/bin/runtests-codeception
# Runs selenium tests
vendor/bin/runtests-selenium
# Runs unit and integration tests
vendor/bin/runtests
```

For running codeception tests in test group **paypal_graphql**, you need the [GraphQL Storefront module](https://github.com/OXID-eSales/graphql-storefront-module/) installed
and the following settings in the `test_config.yml`: 
- Set `partial_module_paths` to `oe/graphql-base,oe/graphql-storefront,oe/oepaypal`
- Set `activate_all_modules` to `true`
- Set `run_tests_for_modules` to `true`
- Set `run_tests_for_shop` to `false`
- Set `additional_test_paths` to `''`
